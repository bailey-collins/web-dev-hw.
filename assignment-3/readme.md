# Assignment 3 ReadMe

A page can technically have as many <head> or <body> elements as the designer would like, but standard practice/courtesy entails there should be only one of each for each page. A <head> element is typically filled with the site's meta data and may contain notes or titles. A <body> element contains the site's data which is viewed by a visitor to the webpage- text, info, links, images, and etc. that are accessible for the viewer to interact with.



 Compared to the last assignment, I had way fewer problems. I tried to follow the advice that I was given when I sought help for the last project, and I feel like it's paid off. On the other hand, I am worried that I'm missing something, but there's no way to tell for sure until someone else looks at all of this. Hopefully, if someone else starts to have similar issues, I can relate back to them the things that helped me get my workspace straightened out.
