- An id attribute is used to label or identify an element in a unique way, which helps to dictate the style of that specific element.
- A class attribute groups together those elements which are similar by assigning the same class to multiple elements and allowing all of those grouped elements to be styled at once.
- A div groups multiple elements of different types together to provide structure and readability instead of strictly style or content.
- A span element works similarly to a div. A span, however, functions inside of a div, grouping together content in order to style of organize it.

Alt text is the text that appears when something on the webpage doesn't load properly or when an attribute is hovered over with a mouse. It provides an alternative method of identifying a media element.

I had a lot of trouble trying to get the relative sources and external sources for my files, especially the video and audio. I, again, tried to follow the directions exactly, and I think I got it after a while. I have noticed that my code doesn't always display properly on GitHub, so I'm trying to get to the bottom of that on my own time. Other than that, I think I got everything down on the webpage.
