# README


I had a lot of trouble trying to get the relative sources and external sources for my files, especially the video and audio. I, again, tried to follow the directions exactly, and I think I got it after a while. I have noticed that my code doesn't always display properly on GitHub, so I'm trying to get to the bottom of that on my own time. Other than that, I think I got everything down on the webpage.
