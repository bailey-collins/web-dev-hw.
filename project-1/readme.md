I wanted to visit a website I actually use with the Wayback Machine, so I chose YouTube. It only went as far back as 2002, but it looked pretty crazy compared to today's YouTube. There were no graphic elements, only links to different 'genres' of video, such as Business, Internet, Travel, and Entertainment. Now, YouTube is overwhelmingly visual medium, as opposed to the text-heavy past.

I had a really hard time with this assignment. My attempts to create a functioning live site are ongoing, though I turned in what I had in order to get something in. I feel like I must be doing something wrong with my file order or naming, though I have tried to follow the course instructions exactly. I posted my problems on the issues board to the best of my ability after struggling with this for a while.
