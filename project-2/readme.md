# Project 2 Technical Report

Learning HTML has been a very interesting, very frustrating process. I went into it knowing absolutely nothing about its structure or rules. It was pretty awesome when something worked correctly and I got to look at a functioning part of a website that I had made. IFrames were particularly fun in this respect. On the other hand, not knowing what I was doing, whenever I made a mistake it was a struggle to figure out what I had done wrong and how to correct it.

CSS is the part that, as a designer, I feel is going to be most frustrating to me. I tend to have a very specific idea of what I want my designs, or 'decorations' to look like. If I can't achieve that, that will probably be very annoying.

I had some trouble with the links and images for this project. I eventually got the links to work and the pictures to show up, but it's still 50/50 if the images display at the correct sizes or not. Either way, I feel much better about this project than the last one, because a majority of the things did what I meant them to do instead of everything spiraling sloppily out of my control.
