I chose some fonts that I use often in photoshop due to their clean but interesting designs. PrinceValiant and GeosansLight seemed like they could be Harry Potter-esque fonts to me, and I wanted to practice self-hosting fonts.

A system font is a font or font family that is downloaded on your personal device. A web font is a font/font family hosted by whichever server you are using. A web-safe font is a font/font family that you can be relatively sure will appear across all websites regardless of device. It is important to include fallback fonts or font stacks when designing to be sure that your website will appear as intended, with a clear and user-friendly design, no matter the device or location it is used.

I had a lot of trouble linking my style pages to my website. From everything I've checked, I've done it right, but for some reason the changes I make just haven't been appearing in the website itself. Unfortunately, I accidently dug myself a hole by completely forgetting I hadn't already done the homework in this class until the last minute, until I decided to check what sort of project there was for next week and saw the due date. So, hopefully I'll have some time to look over the ideas presented next week and figure out where I went wrong.
