# README.md
A Version Control System is a method of working where every change or update is recorded and filed so that you can recover past drafts, see what progress has been made, and easily monitor projects. We use this system in order to view our work in a way that makes it easy to understand what we are doing, how we are doing it, and where we went wrong should we make a mistake and need help.
