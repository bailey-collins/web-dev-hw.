# Assignment 5 Readme

I chose the rainbow graphic for the 70s because I really liked the angular design of it. I'm not so much a fan of the 70s as a decade, but the aesthetics of it are really interesting and fun to work with. I wanted to focus on the colors and the loose, cursive-esque fonts associated with the 70s.

I chose a cross-complementary color scheme with some bright purple, orange, and greens. I used BlueViolet #8A2BE2, GoldenRod #DAA520, and GreenYellow ##ADFF2F.

I had a hard time figuring out how to structure my CSS page. I don't know if I was overcomplicating it for myself, but I felt like I was missing or misusing some key structural elements. I eventually got most of the page to work, but it was pretty touch-and-go. I'm going to keep practicing with it in my downtime, because I'm still pretty shaky about what I'm doing with CSS. I've been checking out other websites and YouTube videos to see if I can find something to make all the concepts click.
